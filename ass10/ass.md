## 8. Name and Email Addresses ##

Write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary as
key-value pairs. The program should display a menu that lets the user look up a
personâ€™s email address, add a new name and email address, change an existing
email address, and delete an existing name and email address. The program should
pickle the dictionary and save it to a file when the user exits the program.
Each time the program starts, it should retrieve the dictionary from the file
and unpickle it.
