# Programming Exercises #


## 1. Kilometer Converter ##

Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, and then converts that
distance to miles. The conversion formula is as follows:
    Miles = Kilometers * 0.6214


##2. Sale Tax Program Refactoring ##

Programming Exercise #6 in Chapter 2 was the Sales Tax program. For that exercise you
were asked to write a program that calculates and displays the county and state sales tax
on a purchase. If you have already written that program, redesign it so the subtasks are in
functions. If you have not already written that program, write it using functions.


## 3. How Much Insurance? ##

Many financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes or build-
ings for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the structure. Write a
program that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a building and then displays
the minimum amount of insurance he or she should buy for the property.


## 4. Automobile Costs ##

Write a program that asks the user to enter the monthly costs for the following expenses
incurred from operating his or her automobile: loan payment, insurance, gas, oil, tires, and
maintenance. The program should then display the total monthly cost of these expenses,
and the total annual cost of these expenses.


##5. Property Tax ##

A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 per-
cent of the property’s actual value. For example, if an acre of land is valued at $10,000,
its assessment value is $6,000. The property tax is then 64¢ for each $100 of the assess-
ment value. The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $38.40. Write a program that
asks for the actual value of a piece of property and displays the assessment value and
property tax.
