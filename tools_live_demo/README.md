# Quick introduction to automating programming assignment work.

Aloong with the proagramming exercises I have made some scripts and Python
tools to help me in being lazy.

 * A shell script to format code in to highlighted RTF.
 * A Python tool for generating PlantUML classes from Python source code.
 * A Python tool to generate SQL database creation commands from a PlantUML
   database diagram.

This all relies havely on [PlantUML - http://plantuml.com](http://plantuml.com)
