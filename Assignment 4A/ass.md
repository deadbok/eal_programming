# Programming Exercises #

This assignment will train Python: repetition structures: while and for
loops, if-else, elif, functions, input, format, numbers, calculations.

1. In the text book “Starting Out with Python - 2nd Edition”,
   do chapter 5: “Programming Exercises”: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

2. Draw a UML Activity Diagram for Exercise 1 and 6.
3. Draw the Hierarchy Diagram for Exercise 6.

It is a requirement, to subdivide the programs into functions. Only do
it to an extend which makes sense.


##  1. Bug Collector ##

A bug collector collects bugs every day for seven days. Write a program that keeps a run-
ning total of the number of bugs collected during the seven days. The loop should ask for
the number of bugs collected for each day, and when the loop is finished, the program
should display the total number of bugs collected.

## 2. Calories Burned ##

Running on a particular treadmill you burn 3.9 calories per minute. Write a program
that uses a loop to display the number of calories burned after 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30
minutes.

## 3. Budget Analysis ##

Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount that he or she has budgeted for a
month. A loop should then prompt the user to enter each of his or her expenses for the
month, and keep a running total. When the loop finishes, the program should display the
amount that the user is over or under budget.

## 4. Distance Traveled ###
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:

    distance = speed * time
    
For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours, the distance traveled is 120
miles. Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and
the number of hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the distance the
vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the desired
output:

    What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40 [enter]
    How many hours has it traveled? 3 [enter]
   Hour    Distance Traveled 
   ---------------------------
    1            40
    2            80
    3           120

## 5. Average Rainfall ##

Write a program that uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average rain-
fall over a period of years. The program should first ask for the number of years. The
outer loop will iterate once for each year. The inner loop will iterate twelve times, once
for each month. Each iteration of the inner loop will ask the user for the inches of rain-
fall for that month. After all iterations, the program should display the number of
months, the total inches of rainfall, and the average rainfall per month for the entire
period.

## 6. Celsius to Fahrenheit Table ##

Write a program that displays a table of the Celsius temperatures 0 through 20 and their
Fahrenheit equivalents. The formula for converting a temperature from Celsius to
Fahrenheit is

         9
         -
    F =  5C + 32
    
where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature. Your program
must use a loop to display the table.
