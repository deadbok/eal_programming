A look into how programs designed to simplify stuff grows over time. I am lazy
and always try to make the computer do stuff for me. During this course I have
developed some tools to help me stay lazy.
 
 * A shell script to drag out every possible information from the hand in
   folder, that is usable in the hand in itself.
   
   * Convert Python source to highlighted .trf files.
   * Generate PlanUML files for al Python classes.
   * Render all PlantUML files to .png
   
 * A Python program to create PlantUML files with classes from Python source
   code.
   
 * A Python program to convert database diagrams from PlantUMl to SQL commands
   to create the tables in the diagram.

In the latest hand in folders these tools are in the tools/ directory of each
hand in.
