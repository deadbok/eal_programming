# Programming Exercises #

 1. In the text book “Starting Out with Python - 2nd Edition”, do chapter 4: “Programming
    Exercises”: 1, 2, 3 and 5.

It is a requirement to:

 1. not use global variables.
 2. subdivide the programs into functions.
 3. use Passing Arguments to Functions.
 4. draw an activity diagram for Exercises: 2, 3 and 5


## 1. Roman Numerals ##

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number within the range of 1 through 10.
The program should display the Roman numeral version of that number. If the number is
outside the range of 1 through 10, the program should display an error message. The fol-
lowing table shows the Roman numerals for the numbers 1 through 10:

| Number | Roman Numeral |
|:-------|:--------------|
|      1 |             I |
|      2 |            II |
|      3 |           III |
|      4 |            IV |
|      5 |             V |
|      6 |            VI |
|      7 |           VII |
|      8 |          VIII |
|      9 |            IX |
|     10 |             X |


## 2. Areas of Rectangles ##

The area of a rectangle is the rectangle’s length times its width. Write a program that asks
for the length and width of two rectangles. The program should tell the user which rectangle
has the greater area, or if the areas are the same.


## 3. Mass and Weight ##

Scientists measure an object’s mass in kilograms and its weight in newtons. If you know the
amount of mass of an object in kilograms, you can calculate its weight in newtons with the
following formula:

    weight = mass * 9.8

Write a program that asks the user to enter an object’s mass, and then calculates its weight.
If the object weighs more than 1,000 newtons, display a message indicating that it is too
heavy. If the object weighs less than 10 newtons, display a message indicating that it is too
light.


## 5. Colour Mixer ##

The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary colors because they cannot be
made by mixing other colors. When you mix two primary colors, you get a secondary color,
as shown here:

 * When you mix red and blue, you get purple.
 * When you mix red and yellow, you get orange.
 * When you mix blue and yellow, you get green.

Design a program that prompts the user to enter the names of two primary colors to mix.
If the user enters anything other than “red,” “blue,” or “yellow,” the program should dis-
play an error message. Otherwise, the program should display the name of the secondary
color that results.
