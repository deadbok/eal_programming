# Programming Exercises #
## Assignment 9 More About Strings ##

This assignment will train Python: strings, lists, file handling, exception
handling, repetition structures: while and for loops, if-else, elif, input,
format, numbers, calculations.

In the text book “Starting Out with Python - 2nd Edition”, do chapter 9:
“Programming Exercises”: 2, 3, 6, and 10.

Optionally do all of the exercises.

The referenced files can be found on Fronter. As text file use:
textErrorList.txt. On the next pages is shown output suggestions. These should
be seen both as inspiration or help and
also as minimum requirements.


### Chapter 9 Exercise 6. Output suggestion. ###
Note that the file content listing and line numbering and word counts is just
for debugging purposes and is not asked for in the exercise. I fact it is just
the last line is asked for as an output.

Round the output off to be only two decimals.

         1: Words: 3 #0    No Error
         2: Words: 3 #100  System Error
         3: Words: 4 #101  Not Enough Memory
         4: Words: 3 #102  Memory Error
         5: Words: 4 #200  Not An Image
        ...
        78: Words: 5 #3001 ROI: Not a polygon
        79: Words: 8 #3002 LCD: string read is not a number
        80: Words: 6 #3003 Barcode: check character not valid
        81: Words: 4 #3004 Meter: parallel lines
        82: Words: 6 #3005 Browser: Not a Browser image.
    
    Average number of words per sentence: 5.12


### Chapter 9 Exercise 7. Output suggestion. ###

The analysed file is: textErrorList.txt
    
    The number of uppercase letters in the file    :  329.00
    The number of lowercase letters in the file    : 1349.00
    The number of digits in the file               :  276.00
    The number of whitespace characters in the file:  440.00

    
## 2. Sum of Digits in a String ##

Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of single-digit numbers
with nothing separating them. The program should display the sum of all the
single digit numbers in the string. For example, if the user enters 2514, the
method should return 12, which is the sum of 2, 5, 1, and 4.


## 3. Date Printer ##

Write a program that reads a string from the user containing a date in the form
mm/dd/yyyy. It should print the date in the form March 12, 2012.


## 6. Average Number of Words ##

If you have downloaded the source code from this book’s companion Web site, you
will find a file named text.txt in the Chapter 09 folder. The text that is in
the file is stored as one sentence per line. Write a program that reads the
file’s contents and calculates the average number of words per sentence.
