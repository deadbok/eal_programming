# Programming Exercises #
## Assignment 4B ##

1. In the text book “Starting Out with Python - 2nd Edition”, do chapter 5: “Programming
   Exercises”:
   7. Pennies for Pay. See output suggestion.
   8. Sum of Numbers
   9. Write a program that uses nested loops to draw this pattern: (see book)
   10. Write a program that uses nested loops to draw this pattern: (see book)
2. It is a requirement, to subdivide the programs into functions. Only do it to an extend which
   makes sense.

### Challenge: Make a program that draws a Christmas tree. ###

3. Challenge: Make the Christmas tree program and also decorate the tree. The decoration
   should be approximately 10% balls `O`, 10% cones `V`, 10% candles `i` and the rest stars
   `*`. The decoration should be random, so no two trees are decorated in the same way. It
   should be possible to enter the number of rows for the tree.
   How many rows should the tree be? 12

                   *
                  ***
                 *VO*V
                *****i*
               ****iiV*O
              V***O*OO***
             **OO********O
            *V*******VVO***
           **OV*******V*O*i*
          *OV*****Vi**V***O**
         iii*V******VO******i*
        **V****i*ii***i******iO
                  ***
                  ***
                 
        Balls: 15 Pct:  10.42
        Cones: 15 Pct:  10.42
        Candl: 14 Pct:   9.72
        Stars: 100 Pct: 69.44
        ----------------------
        Total: 144 Pct: 100.00

4. Challenge: Print out the absolute numbers of balls `O`, cones `V`, candles `i` and stars `*`,
   and also show the percentage of each.

## 7. Pennies for Pay ##

Write a program that calculates the amount of money a person would earn over a period
of time if his or her salary is one penny the first day, two pennies the second day, and
continues to double each day. The program should ask the user for the number of days.
Display a table showing what the salary was for each day, and then show the total pay at
the end of the period. The output should be displayed in a dollar amount, not the number
of pennies.
 

## 8. Sum of Numbers ##

Write a program with a loop that asks the user to enter a series of positive numbers. The
user should enter a negative number to signal the end of the series. After all the positive
numbers have been entered, the program should display their sum.


## 9. Write a program that uses nested loops to draw this pattern: ##

    *******
    ******
    *****
    ****
    ***
    **
    *


## 10. Write a program that uses nested loops to draw this pattern: ##
